# TruthSeekersSRS
A Software Requirements Specification Document for a fictional, satirical social networking application called TruthSeekers.  

Created for CMPT 376W, Summer 2019. Partner project.

* _Completed all sections of document, including formatting, excluding section 4._

Note: The idea for Truthseekers was inspired by a joke our professor made about conspiracy theorists on the Internet spreading false information. We knew he'd enjoy seeing this as the basis of our project. It should be noted that neither I nor my partner for this project would ever participate in a community like Truthseekers.

Just needed to make that clear.
